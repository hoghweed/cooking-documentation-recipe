# Good vs Bad

## What makes today a good or bad documentation? 

<Steps>

- Content...with no doubt :-)
- **Proximity**
- **Accessibility**
- **Layout & Style**
- **Navigation**
- ***Searchability*** (bad word..)

</Steps>

---

# Bad documentation

Having *bad documentation* is like start an adventure through an **ugly menu** which requires <br />
a long time to jump in and **scares us about what we could expect to eat** 

<img src='https://blog.kulturekonnect.com/hubfs/blog_images/bad-menu-design-illegible.jpg' style={{maxHeight: '60%', maxWidth: '60%'}}></img>

---

# Good documentation

*Good documentation* it **ignites the desire to enjoy succulent foods & dishes** opening the mind <br/>
 to the imagination of **what will be there once you enter**

# What's the issue?

# Where is my menu?

<Appear>

## Usually, Confluence is my menu

## What's the problem with that?

- Is not FREE, not accessible
- Is not **close-to-the-code** (probably you have a fantastic plugin, for the poors this is not the case)
- **I Can't be artistic..hard customization**

## I Can't.

</Appear>

---

# Where is my documentation?

<img src={meme} style={{maxHeight: '80%', maxWidth: '30%'}} ></img>

---

# What's the Recipe of a Good Documentation?

<Steps>

- ***proximity***, close to the project
- ***accessibility***, free to access with no restrictions
- ***Layout + Style***, attractive, simple and intuitive 
- ***Navigation***, good structure of contents, effective and consistent organization
- ***Searchability***,  (again bad word..) easy find contents and what needed

</Steps>

# Introduce Vuepress

<img src={vuepress} style={{maxHeight: '50%', maxWidth: '50%', marginLeft: '0'}} ></img>

Vuepress is a **static site generator** with a Vue powered theming system <br /> that comes with a default theme **optimized for technical documentation** 

---

# Why should you love Vuepress?

<Steps>

- Simplicity
- Performance
- Automatica Service Worker
- Multiple Language Support
- Google Analytics Out Of The Box
    - Custom **Alogolia** search
- Theming, Navbar, Features and Document Structure configuration

</Steps>
