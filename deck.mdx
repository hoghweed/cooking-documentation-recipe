# Good vs Bad

## What makes today a good or bad documentation? 

<Steps>

- Content...with no doubt :-)
- **Proximity**
- **Accessibility**
- **Layout & Style**
- **Navigation**
- ***Searchability*** (bad word..)

</Steps>

# Bad documentation

Having *bad documentation* is like start an adventure through an **ugly menu** which requires <br />
a long time to jump in and **scares us about what we could expect to eat**
